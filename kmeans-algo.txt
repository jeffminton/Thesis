Algorithm - K-Means segmentation of data

Algorithm kmeans:
	input:	dat - the data that is to be segmented, must be in the 
				form of a vector where each element contains the 
				information for one discrete peice of data, 
			k - the number of segments to separate the data into
	
	output:	segment_idx - a vector the same length as dat, used to
				store the segment each peice of data belongs to
			segment_means - an array of the mean values of the segments
				in the data. 
	
	means - array of k values to act as mean segment values
	intitialize means with k different values from dat
	newmeans - symmetric array of means, used to store new means
		calculated from segments to compare against old means
	
	for val in dat:
		set corresponding index of val in segment_idx to index of 
		closest value from means array
	
	for mean in means:
		recalculate mean value for each segment using values in dat whos
		coresponding index in segment_idx is equal to the index of mean
		in means, store new value innewmeans array
	
	**process data until values in means do not change after an
		iteration through the data**
	while newmeans not = means:
		means = newmeans - set means to values in newmeans
		
		for val in dat:
			recalculate segments as above
		
		for mean in means:
			recalculate mean value for each segment as above
			
	return segment_idx, segment_means
